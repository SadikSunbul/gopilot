> ⚠️ **Note**: This project is still under development and currently only supports Gemini LLM.

## 📖 Overview

Gopilot is a powerful Go library that transforms natural language commands into programmatic actions. Using LLM (Large Language Model) technology, it provides an intelligent interface that can match text-based user inputs with predefined APIs, functions, and agents for execution.

## 🌟 Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and processing user commands in natural language
- **Intelligent Action Matching**: Converting text inputs into appropriate API/function calls
- **Context Awareness**: Remembering previous actions and making contextual decisions
- **Interactive Verification**: User confirmation for critical actions
- **Configurable Workflow**: Customizable action flows and parameters

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Architecture

- **LLM Integration**: Currently supports Gemini LLM
- **Agent System**: Modular structure with customizable agents
- **Context Management**: Memory system tracking historical actions and states

### Use Cases

```go
// Agent definition example
agent := gopilot.NewAgent(config)

// Natural language command processing
response, err := agent.Process("enable developer mode")

// Contextual command processing
response, err := agent.Process("undo last action")
```

## 💡 Example Usage

Gopilot allows you to perform complex application functions with simple text commands:

1. **Setting Changes**:
   ```text
   "enable developer mode" -> DevMode.Enable()
   "increase debug level" -> Logger.SetLevel(DEBUG)
   ```

2. **Contextual Operations**:
   ```text
   "undo last action" -> [Automatically applies reverse of previous action]
   "save recent changes" -> [Selects appropriate save operation based on context]
   ```

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
go get github.com/user/gopilot
```
